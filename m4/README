### in this milestone we added a shell support for the rest of CRUD operations on a file in addition to adding a command dir, which lists all files in a directory, and create which creates a text file. Lastly, a function called writeSector was added to support the file operations.

### Instructions for building your operating system
$ ./compileOS

### Instructions for testing and using the operating system
$ ./compileOS

testing writeSector:
1. modify main to call an interrupt with AX = 6, BX = the address of a character array holding the sector to write, CX = the sector number
sample code:
char testStr[5], secondBuf[5];
testStr[0] = 'h';
testStr[1] = 'e';
testStr[2] = 'y';
testStr[3] = 'o';
testStr[4] = '\0';

makeInterrupt21();
interrupt(0x21, 6, testStr, 2, 0); /*this is the write sector */
interrupt(0x21, 2, secondBuf, 2, 0); /* this is to read the sector just written */
interrupt(0x21, 1, testStr, 0, 0); /* print out base string */
interrupt(0x21, 1, secondBuf, 0, 0); /* print out string we read from sector */

2. writeSector must also function for the tests below, so feel free to run those first and if they work then writeSector must also work

testing deleteFile:
1. In compileOS.sh, add in a line to load in a text file you wish to delete for instance:
./loadFile myfavesongs.txt

in the shell, execute the following command:
type myfave

verify the output of your file
next enter the delete command followed by another type
delete myfave
type myfave

verify the output is no longer the same as what was in your file beforehand, expect a 'File Not Found' error instead

testing writeFile:
1. in the shell, execute the following command:
type coolfi
expect 'File Not found' error
create coolfi
you are now free to enter input, which can be terminted by pressing enter on an empty line
once you're done entering input, enter this:
type coolfi
you should now see the input you entered to the file.

testing copyFile:
1. load in the standard message.txt
in the shell, enter the following command:
type messag
copy messag m2
type m2

testing dir:
1. in the shell, execute the following command:
dir
a list of file names and number of sectors should display for the current directory

### Bugs or deficiencies
Such things do not exist

### Additional features that we implemented
Sector sizes in the dir command
